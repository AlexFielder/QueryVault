# QueryVault
This addin lets the user pull Vault Professional data into an Excel spreadsheet

It is designed to only work in Excel files that have "Project Tracker" as part of their filename.

The original used a regular Vault login but since I have it configured I am as of 2016-09-09 attempting to have the addin use the Windows Authentication method.
UNFORTUNATELY, this isn't working for some reason. Please see this thread for more details: http://forums.autodesk.com/t5/vault-customization/updating-apps-from-vault-professional-2014-to-vault-professional/td-p/6552900
